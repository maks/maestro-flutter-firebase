# Firebase Auth 101

A simple demo of Firebase Auth using [code from the Flutter codelab](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/firebase-auth-in-flutter-apps) with some small code fixes by me.

## Notes

Firebase project config here is for a temporary Firebase project that is only available for a short period of time, if you use this code for your own work please make sure to change the configuration in [`lib/firebase_options.dart`](lib/firebase_options.dart). 

Also note the configuration is only for building for android & ios.
